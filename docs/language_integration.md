# Language Integration Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the process for integrating multiple languages into the Feverducation platform. Each language will have its own JSON file containing translations for all text used in the application.

## Directory Structure
All language files are stored in the `/locales` directory:
```
/locales
|-- en.json   # English translations
|-- es.json   # Spanish translations
|-- fr.json   # French translations
|-- ...       # Other languages
```

## Language File Structure
Each language file contains key-value pairs for translations. For example, `en.json` might look like:
```json
{
  "greeting": "Hello",
  "farewell": "Goodbye",
  "teacher_portal": {
    "title": "Teacher Portal",
    "user_management": "User Management"
  }
}
```

## Adding a New Language
1. Create a new JSON file in the `/locales` directory (e.g., `de.json` for German).
2. Populate the file with translations, following the same structure as existing files.
3. Update the frontend to include logic for switching languages based on user preference.

## Usage in Frontend
In the frontend, import the appropriate language file based on user selection. For example:
```javascript
import translations from '../locales/en.json';
```

## Future Modifications
- Ensure all new text added to components is included in the language files.
- Maintain consistency in key naming across different languages for easier management.
